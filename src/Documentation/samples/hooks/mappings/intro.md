# Mappings

Mappings allow you to change the locations of content items before they are migrated to the destination.

> [!Note]
> Mappings do not have a cascading effect. You will need to write similar mappings for the related content items as well.

The following samples cover some common scenarios:

- [Sample: Username email](~/samples/hooks/mappings/username_email_mapping.md)
- [Sample: Rename projects](~/samples/hooks/mappings/rename_projects.md)
- [Sample: Change projects](~/samples/hooks/mappings/change_projects.md)

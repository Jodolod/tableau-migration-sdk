# Tableau Migration SDK

The Tableau Migration SDK is a client library to facilitate migration of user data between Tableau environments.

## Get started

### Logging

This SDK logging uses [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/main/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions).
With this, you can use the Logging implementation of your choice, like:

- [Microsoft Logging](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging?tabs=command-line)
- [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog)
- [NLog](https://github.com/NLog/NLog.Extensions.Logging)

## Configuration: Environment Variables

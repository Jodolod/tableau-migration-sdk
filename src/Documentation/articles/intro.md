# Introduction

The Migration SDK is primarily written in C# using the [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet-framework) Framework. To enable interoperability with Python, it also includes a [Python Wrapper](~/api-python/index.md). The articles in this section delve into useful information to help you design and write your migration application.

This documentation also contains [Code Samples](~/samples/intro.md) to give you a head start.
